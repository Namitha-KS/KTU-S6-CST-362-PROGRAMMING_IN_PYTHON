The morning mist swirled around the ancient ruins, a thick, white fog that muffled the world in an ethereal silence.  The stones, weathered and worn by time, whispered secrets in a language only the wind understood. Everywhere you looked, there were crumbling arches and toppled columns, each piece a testament to a civilization long gone.  The silence was broken only by the occasional cry of a bird, echoing strangely through the empty courtyards.  As the sun began to peek through the mist, casting long shadows across the ruins, it felt as if history itself was coming alive, a story waiting to be unraveled.
