The morning mist swirled round the ncient ruins,  thick, white fog tht muffled the world in n etherel silence.  The stones, wethered nd worn by time, whispered secrets in  lnguge only the wind understood. Everywhere you looked, there were crumbling rches nd toppled columns, ech piece  testment to  civiliztion long gone.  The silence ws broken only by the occsionl cry of  bird, echoing strngely through the empty courtyrds.  As the sun begn to peek through the mist, csting long shdows cross the ruins, it felt s if history itself ws coming live,  story witing to be unrveled.
